### Test

In Customer Groups, we tested numerous designs. This was yet another first-time project for the entire team, so we were all learning as we went. Receiving feedback from our customers ensured that the designs were not subjective.

We asked our test groups to perform typical user journeys, which we observed through a one-way mirror. If we wanted to understand a specific decision or action, we could also ask questions at the end of the sessions.
