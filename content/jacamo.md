Introduction
In 2010 it was clear that we were falling behind our competitors by only having a fixed width desktop website. Based on our tracking data we could see that our customers were increasingly using their mobile phones to access our site, but what the stats showed was that our customers were dropping out at crucial points in the transaction process. We had to find out why customers were dropping out at those points and develop a solution to prevent this.
A project started to rewrite the frontend so that it was optimised for mobile devices. Pages were worked on one by one and were prioritised by the business based on benefits to them and the customer. We used Agile methodology so that we could release new feautres as and when they were ready.

Mobile optimisation was the start of the responsive layout revolution.

Approached to the design
This was the first of the big optimisation projects. It coincided with what really was a mobile revolution that completely changed the way designers and web developers think about the website experience.
What we know now was very much unknown back then. There wasn't much experience around mobile design and we were still very much all about producing flat Photoshop mockups of the various scenarios and journeys. We still did sketching and wireframes to get an agreement on the basic layouts, but interactions were never more than arrows on a sketch, which can be fine for very early stages but doesn't give you teh complete picture.
Build decisions
The build took place in stages; the team first produced flat mockup pages which we could show to the business the various versions. Once agreed we would then build the markup using static HTML pages. This code would later be integrated into JSP pages of the application where it could be properly tested with a variety of dynamic data.
The styling for mobile was developed with scope in mine. This was in part due to the Agile nature of the development process - common styles were grouped together, but dedicated CSS was developed for each page. This made it more difficult as we had to maintain two codebases without being able to develop with the whole website in mind.
Testing strategy
We used prototypes for the first time on this project. Sandboxes were used to upload static HTML pages to give the business some idea of what the interactions would be like. Feedback could then be fed back into the designs and another iteration would be released for the same review.
No one really knew what the best designs would be so we took our prototypes to a testing agency that specialised in customer testing, Q&A focus groups, two-way mirrors and recordings. This gained us valuable insight, not only to which of our designs worked best but to how customers interacted with their phones.

The 'checkout' optimisation increased conversion from 2% to 4%. The 'browse' optimisation increased it to 8%.
