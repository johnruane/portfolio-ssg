UI / UX Designer test

---

> Online sales accounted for 20% of total sales in 2005, to 70% in 2010.

---

### Design

I was able to focus on an idea thanks to pen and paper sketches.

Based on Marketing requirements, I created wireframes and mock-ups in Photoshop.

New features may necessitate the testing of prototypes during Usability Testing sessions.

Axure can be used to create animated user interactions.

---

> Fixed width website no longer fit for high resolution monitors and the advent of mobile browsing

---

### Build

Working with a legacy codebase that is more than ten years old

Support for legacy browsers is required, which usually entails CSS hacks.

There are no consistent coding standards.

---

> Decreased release cycle time: 6 weeks -> 2 weeks

---

### Test

Poor testing environments lacked the necessary data to test all scenarios.

Stub data was typically required for local development.

Virtual machines and browser emulation plugins

Due to an elderly, non-tech savvy customer base, browsers were slow to be updated, resulting in extended legacy support.

Customers made a large number of sales while using work computers. Companies such as the NHS restrict system upgrades, so operating systems and browsers are rarely updated.

Because the business is slow to accept browser style differences, many nitpicky bugs have been raised.

---

> Codebase shared with 15+ brands.

---

### Challenges

CSS style clashes

CSS and JS'magic numbers'

There is no code consistency.

The spaghetti code

Easy to break something.

---

> Looking back it was a bit of a wild west in terms of standards and consistency. JS, especially, lacked any authroity. No thought was given to adding a bit of animation here or a plugin there.

### Likes

Developing concepts into functional components

Working as part of a group. Learning from your peers

The project where I honed my frontend skills

### Dislikes

There is no notion of a Design System or modular components.

Legacy support was aggravating.

Business was slow to adopt new methods of operation; old habits die hard.

Requirements are frequently presented in the form of "Can you make it look like [competitor's] website?"

### Lessons

Solid knowledge of HTML and CSS

How to present new features from the design stage to prototypes

In-person courses on UX, Scrum, and advanced Javascript were taken.
