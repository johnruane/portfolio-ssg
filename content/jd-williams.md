Role: UI Designer

Responsibilty: The project I cut my professional frontend developer teeth on. Wireframe, prototype, and build (HTML, CSS, JS) new features. Maintain legacy codebase.

Agile development 6 weeks to 2 weeks

Fluid design for high resolution monitors

The N Brown website has been completely transformed since I started in 2005. Running parallel to the other optimisation projects has been a Tactical workstream designed to yield quick functional benefits on a regular basis, rather than a big bang release after a prolonged period of time. Projects that can be conceived, built, tested and released in a short time frame (usually 2 weeks) in order to continually improve the website.
Recently the Desktop has been undergoing changes to make it more fluid as desktop screen widths become more varied.

Online sales increased from 20% in 2005 to 70% in 2010.

The design

Pen & paper sketches allow you to focus on an idea.

Wireframse and Mock-ups done in Photoshop based on Marketing requirements. 

New features might warrent prototypes to be tested in Usibility Testing sessions.

Axure prototypes for showing animated UI for user interactions.

The build

Legacy codebase over 10 years old

Support required for legacy broswers - usually involved CSS hacks

No consistent codding standards.

Biggest problem was CSS cascade

Tools used: Dreamweaver

No concept of a Design System or modular components.

Working with JSP pages

The build process for desktop could go down one of two routes: for small projects I would make the markup/css changes in the existing files whilst running a local build of the code on my machine, for larger projects I would build these pages using an editor such as Dreamweaver and then collaborate with a Java developer to integrate this into the codebase (usually) in the form of JSP pages.
The biggest challenge was working with code that was first developed in 1999. It had gone through 3rd party developers and many in-house developers - it was a spaghetti code in places. The concept of modular: modules, components & reusability were not as prevalent as they are now so the code grew with little planning and foresight of the wider whole. The code became very fragile and was easily broken.

Testing

Poor testing environments lacked data for testing all scenarios

Local development usually made extensive use of stub data

Browser emulation plugins & virtual machines

Aged non-tech savvy customerbase meant browsers were slow to be updated.

Business slow to accept browser style differences so testing was nit-picky

Because we usually ran a copy of the website on a local server we were able to test any work we did with stub data. Browser support was extensive due to the many versions used by our customers whom a large percentage seldom updated their computers. For a long time we would be including browser specific hacks or css work arounds in order to get the display the same on every browser. Thankfully these days its given that there may be small differences between browsers, and that these differences are not an issue worth resolving.
Most browsers now have the ability emulate various devices and legacy versions. If you want to 100% test something though then there is no substitute to actually using that device or legacy browser - for this I use virtual machines.

In some form or other, I've been working on the desktop website since I started in 2005.
