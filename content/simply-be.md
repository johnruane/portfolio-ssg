Introduction
After the success of the mobile optimisation project the focus moved to the second most popular device for browsing our websites - the tablet. In 2011 the team split into two: one group would work carry on optimising the mobile experience and offer bug fixing and support, whilst the other team followed the same planning and execution we had used for mobile to start optimising for tablet devices.
The tablet was again a new device to the team therefore we used customer testing to review designs and get live feedback from our customers. It also allowed us to listen to their thinking whilst they navigated the designs, which gave us a deeper insight.

Traffic on Tablet devices accounts for 66% of sales.

Approach to the design
The front end design was a mixture of Photoshop mockups and prototypes. Myself and the business were still most comfortable with producing and reviewing flat photoshop mockups. They were quick to produce and review, but the downside was they didnt show the screen at all widths - this did lead to some unexpected outcomes.
A lot of the early designs were to see what features to bring across from the desktop and what features we could afford to lose in order to optimise the tablet experience for the user.
Build decisions
The build was a typical browser/Dreamweaver affair. As this was a new frontend it allowed us to optimise the CSS and HTML code and clear out all the dead code that had built up in the older site.
The build was again first done on the pages that provided the business and customer the most benefit ie. checkout, product details etc. This again was an Agile project so we could gradually release new functionality as and when it was ready.
Testing strategy
We tested a lot of designs in Customer Groups. This was another first-time project for the whole team, so we were learning as we were doing. Getting feedback from our customers meant the designs we not subjective.
Typical user journeys were asked of our test groups and we would observe them through a one-way mirror. Questions could also be asked at the end of the sessions if we wanted to understand a particular decision or action.
