2013 - 2015

#### Role
UI / UX Designer

---
> Mobile optimisation increased conversions from 2% to 8%. 
---
### Design

We took several prototypes to UX focus groups because mobile design was new territory for everyone involved.

Crazy 8's sketching method for rapid solution iteration

Based on Marketing requirements, I created wireframes and mock-ups in Photoshop.

> Mobile optimisation was the start of the responsive layout revolution at N Brown.
---

### Build

Static HTML pages were created using stub data for later integration into JSP pages.

The new file architecture enabled component and stylesheet modularization.

Brand styling was still provided by existing CSS files, which produced unexpected results when applied on top of the new stylesheets.

> TODO

### Test

Sandboxes were used to upload pages for approval.

Prototypes were delivered to a UX agency in order to conduct focus groups with two-way mirrors and recordings. Following that, feedback would be incorporated into future design changes.

### Challenges

Initial testing was carried out using browser emulation. Wasn't entirely accurate

Working with existing brand stylesheets layered on top of new CSS resulted in unexpected results.

There weren't enough real devices in the company to test with.

> This project was the catalyst for building an in-house device lab

### Likes

This is my first time designing for mobile. This project has taught me a lot.

Opportunity to create something from the ground up using best practises and standards

### Dislikes

The final design was not groundbreaking. The look and feel were heavily influenced by existing designs.

It was difficult to debug issues on devices for which we did not have physical copies.

### Lessons

Design and testing for mobile devices

Testing UX with real-world customers
