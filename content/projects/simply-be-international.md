### Design

The design was incorporated into the construction. Designs were created as interactive HTML files with stub data.

These designs could then be reviewed by the business on any device and approved or modified, resulting in a circular process of design, review, and refinement.

### Build

The frontend was built with a customised version of Bootstrap that is modular and can be reused across the codebase.

To modularize the CSS and have only styles related to a specific brand, we used the LESS stylesheet language, which we built with a JS package runner.

All reusable styles were written as variables so that each brand could have different values and the CSS output would be a unique combination distinct from the other brands once compiled.

We also used the JS task runner to compile the pages made up of the various UI blocks we'd created.

### Test

For this project, testing was simplified.

Because our customer base is not as tech-savvy as that of other ecommerce brands, it would take a significant amount of effort to ensure that legacy browsers were supported.

It was costly and time consuming to ensure that the UI displayed consistently across multiple browser versions. It also hampered design by preventing new features from taking advantage of new browser capabilities.

The Bootstrap framework had been thoroughly tested, and any bugs that were discovered were quickly resolved.

Before developing designs, we used browser emulation to test them. We had our own testing lab with a wide range of mobile devices for device testing.

### Challenges 

Working with an international agency was difficult. Timezones and code views were less than ideal during video calls.

The agency worked on deadlines, and we relied on them to meet them, which was difficult.

### Likes

Working with Boostrap taught us how frameworks are built, which we would apply to our next project.

### Dislikes

Giving code to a third party for integration meant we lost control over the final product.

Because old design habits were applied here, the new website was not very revolutionary.

### Lessons

Diplomacy in collaboration with an agency

Responsive design

Making use of a framework
